- Blue Cubes: Numbered 10, 12, and 13.
- Red Cubes: Numbered 14, 15, 16, and 17.

In this task, I need to set 2 red cubes on top of each other on the green target.
The red cubes are labeled as label 14, 15, 16, 17, and the green target as label 11.
All other objects, including the blue cubes, parts of the robotic arm, and the background, are distractions.
