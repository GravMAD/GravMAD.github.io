The desktop has various colored jars, a jar lid, a banana and some numbers associated with them.
- A yellow cylindrical jar labeled as 8.
- A purple cylindrical jar labeled as 9.
- A banana labeled as 6.
- A small grey lid labeled as 10.
In this task, I need to close the jar closer to the banana.
The yellow jar is closer to banana which is labeled as label 8, and lid as label 10.
All other objects, including the purple jar, parts of the robotic arm, and the background, are distractions.
