The desktop has various colored jars, a jar lid and some numbers associated with them.
- A red cylindrical jar labeled as 9.
- A green cylindrical jar labeled as 10.
- A small grey lid labeled as 11.
In this task, I need to screw the grey lid onto the red jar.
The red jar is labeled as label 9, and lid as label 11.
All other objects, including the green jar, parts of the robotic arm, and the background, are distractions.
