This is a robotic arm wrist view. The desktop has a steak, a chicken and some numbers associated with them.
- Steak label as 14.
- Chicken label as 13.
- Chicken place target, i.e. next to the grill, as 5.
In this task, I need to pick up the meat and place it next to the grill.
The chicken is labeled as label 13, and meat place target space as label 5.
All other objects, including the steak 14, parts of the robotic arm 6, and the background, are distractions.
