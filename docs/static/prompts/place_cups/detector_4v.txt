- Cup holder spoke: Numbered 3, 13.
- Cups: Numbered 9, 10 and 12.
In this task, I need to pick up 3 mugs and slide their handles onto the cup holder spokes.
The cups are labeled as label 9, 10 and 12, and the cup holder spoke as label 3, 13.
All other objects, including the cup holder base 8, parts of the robotic arm 4 5, and the background, are distractions.
